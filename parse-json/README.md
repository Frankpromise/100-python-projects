When it comes to using python for #DevOps or #SRE work, parsing files is a common task. Hence, the importance of knowing how to #parse JSON files using #python.

Here is a complete example script that makes use of JSON and #os python module to retrieve the absolute path of a #JSON file, thereafter #looping to print all the keys and values of the JSON file.

Another example is when you want to retrieve specific information from a remote API. Here, a free remote API that stores cat facts is used as an example to retrieve just the facts about cats. To achieve this, the #json and #urllib2 python #module is used.
