# Disk Report
python shutil module has quite a lot of interesting submodles.

Shutil module provides a lot of functionality to perform operations on files and collections. It also has a functionality that allows for the removal and copy of files.



Although it shares quite a number of similarities with the python #os module, but the OS module does not have functions dealing with the collection of files.



An interesting use of the #shutil module is illustrated in this snippet where I used the #diskspace submodule to check how much free disk space I have left in numbers and also in percentage.
